# PKU Computer Architecture Lab
# 2017 fall
## by xueben

This lab is built by **Visual Studio Community 2017** with **VC++**, run on **thinkpadX260** with **windows10**


## Run directly

If you want to run the programme directly, click the "yuv2.exe" in 

```
root/yuv2.exe
```

## Build by yourself

If you want to build the source code by yourself, just load the code in your visual studio.

**Use VC++ compiler**, and run on a **windows** machine.

## Part I: fade in fade out
The result of part 1 will be located in 

```
root/part1
```

which have 4 sub-directory: no_simd, mmx, sse2, avx, each of them contains the video generated by programme

**Note: These directories are all empty when given, which means the video you will see is not pre-stored.**

if you want to play a yuv video, choose the video in them

```
root/part1/no_simd/figure.yuv
```

## Part II: picture_merge

checkout Part I and change all the "part1" in the path to "part2", you can find the video, for example, to see
a video generated by programme with avx acceleration, find it in:

```
root/part2/avx/figure.yuv
```
